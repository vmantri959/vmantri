       A Little Bit About Me....


   </h1>


   <p class="a">


       I am a sophmore at Purdue University majoring in Electrical Engineering and pursuing a minor in Mathematics. These subjects provide me a platform to solve challenging problems and there is potential for unlimited growth.


       <br> I was born in New Jersey, although the majority of my childhood was spent in Pune, India. In addition to English, I also speak Marathi fluently and can understand and speak basic Hindi. I have also studied Sanskrit for three years.







       <br>


       <br> Besides academics, I enjoy going to the gym and discussing politics and current events. I also play the tabla, a classical Indian instrument.
